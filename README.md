Arcfund is mainly about to simplify the process of project initiation of DAO organizations and project parties, and is the easiest way to crowdfund and raise money for a DAO. It also makes crowdfunding or token launching/selling easier.

### How to solve?

Arcfund is a set of open source smart contracts based on solidity Smart Contracts  and designed to simplify the process of project initiation for DAO organizations and project stakeholders. Like traditional crowdfunding platforms, Arcfund's crowdfunding feature allows you to raise money for projects or ideas. According to the code of conduct for crowdfunding, you need to fill in the project name, details, set the target amount of crowdfunding and the way of feedback. After participating in crowdfunding and obtaining tokens, you can further participate in the community vote. Voting is the most important application for a mature DAO. This represents the collective preferences and decisions of the DAO participants regarding any resolution.
